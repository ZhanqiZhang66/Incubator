# Progress Made
We used the Tx and Rx pins to establish a serial communication line between Arduino and Photon. The Photon now has access to sensor reads.
In additon, we also have establish the communication between the website and Photon, based on our code for previous assignments. 
Finally , a complete the hardware system was built up and tested.

# Problems and potential concerns
Still need more test to fix the UI. 

# Priorities for the next week
Add more features into the UI, especially temperature control.
